TASK 1: ARCHITECTURE
1. Build network for classification problem
2. Study memory requirements and computational loads for different layers

Main idea: use MNIST and start with small network, test different layers and architectures

TASK 2: TRAINING
1. Study impact in performance of DATA AUGMENTATION, batches size, batch normalization
2. Training validation curves
3. Overfitting

TASK 3: VISUALIZATION
1. Visualize filter responses from own and also pretrained net
2. t-SNE
3. Off-the-shelf AlexNet

TASK 4: TRANSFER LEARNING
1. Train network on CIFAR10 and fine-tune for Terrassa Buildings 900
2. Off-the-shelf convnet

TASK 5: OPEN PROJECT

DATASETS:
Keras has classes to download MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. 
We should do the same for Terrassa Buildings 900. The link of the dataset is the following:
